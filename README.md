Challenge:
"Imagine we have a simple customer database and another transactions database. We would like to expose the data as a RESTful API adopting a micro-services pattern. While also looking to simplify, we would like to implement a GraphQL interface.

Using the stack of your choice, build a database (any type) and build a REST API around it. Then unify the two APIs through a GraphQL one that we can test."

Bonus Microservice: Imagine a third service takes some of the transactions and using a ML model, predicts a specific amount to be spent by a user. Try integrating the live prediction.


Deliverables:
1. API for the customer database, API for the transactions database and GraphQL API 

2. GitHub link for the core code
